Lab 00 Instructions -- Hello, World!
========

This is a sample lab to exemplify the workflow of a traditional CS051 lab
with the addition of Git and GitHub.

## Getting Started

If you haven't already configured your development environment, be sure to do
so before proceeding -- this only needs to be completed once for the entire
semester (or per machine). For instructions head over to the [Lab Guide](https://pomonacs051.github.io/studentguide/#getting-started).
Follow the instrcutions in the **Getting Started** section and also read the
section regarding **[Tools You Will Be Using](https://pomonacs051.github.io/studentguide/#tools-you-will-be-using)**.

## Get the Starter Code

Once you have everything configured, the next steps can be followed for each
lab.

1. Get the [starter code](https://pomonacs051.github.io/studentguide/#getting-new-assignemnts).
2. [Create a new branch for the assignment](https://pomonacs051.github.io/studentguide/#branch).

Now you are ready to begin the lab! You should have a Lab00 directory in
Eclipse's Package Explorer that contains the following next to the directory:
`[cecil-sagehen_fa2015 lab00]`. `lab00` indicates the branch you
currently have checked out, so if it says anything other than that, be sure
to switch branches. (See the guide for info on how to do this.)

## Hello, World!

1. In Eclipses Package Explorer expand the Lab00 directory to see the source
   files for the lab.
2. Open `HelloWorld.java` to edit it.
3. In the following line (line 5), change `<YourNameHere>` to be your name.
   ```java
   private String yourName = "<YourNameHere>";
   ```
4. Save and launch your code by clicking the large green and white play
   button at the top of the screen.
5. If everything is working, you should see something like "Hello, Cecil!" in
   a new window!

## Commit, Push, and Request Grading

1. [Commiting Instructions](https://pomonacs051.github.io/studentguide/#develop-your-code-and-commit-your-work)
